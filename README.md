I have implemented my own version of the famous web-based word-guessing game Wordle that 
has become popular in the last few years. This is a "guess the secret word" kind of game. 
For each puzzle, a particular 5-letter English word has been chosen as the secret, and the player tries to
infer what it is by making a series of guesses. If the player can find the
secret word, then they win!
